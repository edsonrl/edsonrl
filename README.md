I finished my Ph.D. in July 2020 and during this time I worked on making Apache Hive self-tuning. I extended [Starfish](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2011/Papers/CIDR11_Paper36.pdf) (a Hadoop tuning advisor), added some cool features, and integrated it with [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/). Unfortunately, this code is private due to a patent. You can read more about it in these papers:
