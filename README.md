I finished my Ph.D. in July 2020 and during this time I worked on making Apache Hive self-tuning. I extended [Starfish](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2011/Papers/CIDR11_Paper36.pdf) (a Hadoop tuning advisor), added some cool features, and integrated it with [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/). Unfortunately, this code is private due to a patent. You can read more about it in these papers:

- [Investigating Automatic Parameter Tuning for SQL-on-Hadoop Systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214579621000216)
- [Don’t Tune Twice: Reusing Tuning Setups for SQL-on-Hadoop Queries](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-33223-5_9)
